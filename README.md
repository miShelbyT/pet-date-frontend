# Mod 3 Pairs Project with Demetrio Lima: 

Pet Dates is pet date scheduler app that allows the user to add a new pet, peruse a list of current pet clients, and view, save, update and delete pet dates.

We created this app with the following:

* Set up Javascript Front End and Ruby on Rails API
* Implemented vanilla JS for fetches, event listeners and other DOM manipulation 
* Handled serializers on Rails back end to access/manage data
* Used vanilla CSS for all styling including overlays, modals, etc. 


## A big thanks to our Flatiron cohort-mates for sending us their pet information.
